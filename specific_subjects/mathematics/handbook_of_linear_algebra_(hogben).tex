\section{Fourier Analysis}
Fourier transform: 
$\mathcal{F} [\phi]|_x = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \phi (y) e^{-i2\pi xy}dy$
\\~\\
Inverse Fourier transform: 
$\mathcal{F}^{-1} [\phi]|_x = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \phi(y) e^{i2\pi xy}dy$
\\~\\
Fourier series:
$\sum\limits_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} c_k e^{i2\pi \omega_k y}dy$
\\~\\
Convolution: 
$\phi * \psi (x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \phi (x-y) \psi (y) dy$
\\~\\
\followup{Why is convolution defined the way it is?} $\Rightarrow$ continuous analog of multiplication; generalized linear combination of translations; 
`effect' function times `quantity of event' function (examples: smoke function of firework and number of fireworks through time); important that $x$ is a constant in the integral (analogous to time in the example)
